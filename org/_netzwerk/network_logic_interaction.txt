things to discuss/decide on network-logic interaction

the network player will implement various functionalities that the logic will need to access to communicate to the enemy player
    - how should these functionalities be accessed? (e.g. public methods)
    - list of functionalities as of now:
        - ready-ping:   asks the enemy how many ships he has placed and if he is ready to start the game
        - begin:        if we are the host, we need to flip a coin on who begins the game, does logic want to handle that or should network do this? (easy to implement for both)
        - fire:         attack the enemy
        - end:          tell the enemy the game has ended and who the winner is

the network player will receive various information from the enemy player which needs to be forwarded to the logic
    - how should this forwarding mechanism work? (e.g. change a property and notify logic via observer)
    - list of information that will be received as of now:
        - ready-ping:   int describing how many ships the enemy has placed until now
        - begin:        if we are the client, we receive info on who begins the game
        - fire:         where the enemy wants to fire at
        - fire:         reponse to our fire attack
        - end:          enemy has determined the game has ended and who the winner is
